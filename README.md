This project was coded and worked on in Nov-Dec 2023 for the main purpose of learning how to use MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, Node.js, in a full stack app.

The functionality to retrive new blog posts from database and render for new users & new user register and login using JWT is not working yet, however since this program is purely for learning processes, its put on backburner to fix later.
